This repository is designed to hold a variety of demonstration sinewave
generators.  These sinewave generators will be discussed and used as examples on
[zipcpu.com](http://zipcpu.com).  If you watch carefully, you may find examples
here before they are posted, as I'm going to be doing my development here.

The basic approach in this project is that of a software core generator,
found in the [sw](sw/) directory.  This generator can be used to make
logic in the [rtl](rtl/) directory.

The reference that I have used to build the CORDIC algorithms within this
repository comes from a [Cordic
Survey](http://www.andraka.com/files/crdcsrvy.pdf), by Ray Andraka.
